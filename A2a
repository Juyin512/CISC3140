the list is blank.

3) Clicked on “Create an Assignment”
4) Clicked on the ‘category’ list to select a category of the assignment , the list is blank, there is nothing to select
5) clicked on “Save” button, error message pops up says that “select an category before saving”.

Expected Result: when click on the category list, it should show up a list of the category.

Actual Result: the list is blank and doesn’t have anything to choose, which prevent me to save an assignment.
Notes:  check and make sure GUI code is free of bugs
