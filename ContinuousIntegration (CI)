Continuous Integration (CI)
Continuous Integration (CI) is a development practice where developers integrate code into a shared repository frequently, preferably several times a day. 
Each integration can then be verified by an automated build and automated tests.

Benefits: 
integrating regularly is that you can detect errors quickly and locate them more easily. 
significantly reduced integration problems and allows a team to develop cohesive software more rapidly.


Build automation two major components:
The process for transformation source artifacts (code, database schema, documentation, etc.)
Compilation
Linking
Packaging
Deployment
Data migration
Backup
Notification

The application of quality assurance measures during said transformation
Compiler warnings / errors
Unit tests
Integration tests
System tests
Deployment authentication

good CI tools will let you address all of these concerns.
